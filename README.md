# XTT IoT security protocol

XTT is a C implementation of the [XTT
protocol](https://xaptum.github.io/xtt-spec/) for securing Internet of
Things (IoT) network traffic.  It provides scalable identity
provisioning, device authentication, and data integrity and
confidentiality.

TODO: Actually briefly summarize protocol justification and features.

# Project Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xaptum/xtt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xaptum/xtt)

## Installation

`xtt` is available for the following distributions. It may also be
built from source.

### Debian (Jessie or Stretch)

``` bash
# Install the Xaptum API repo GPG signing key.
apt-get adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys c615bfaa7fe1b4ca

# Add the repository to your APT sources, replacing <dist> with either jessie or stretch.
echo "deb http://dl.bintray.com/xaptum/deb <dist> main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/xaptum.list

# Install the library.
sudo apt-get install libxtt-dev
```

### Homebrew (MacOS)

``` bash
# Tap the Xaptum Homebrew repository.
brew tap xaptum/xaptum

# Install the library.
brew install xtt
```

## Installation from Source

### Build Dependencies

* CMake (version 3.0 or higher)
* A C99-compliant compiler

* [ECDAA](https://github.com/xaptum/ecdaa) (version 0.8.4 or higher)
* [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) (version 1.0.11 or higher)
* [xaptum-tpm](https://github.com/xaptum/xaptum-tpm) (version 0.5.0 or higher)
  * If building XTT with TPM support

## Building the Library

```bash
# Create a subdirectory to hold the build
mkdir -p build
cd build

# Configure the build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

# Build the library
cmake --build .

# Run the tests
ctest -V
```

In addition to the standard CMake options the following configuration
options and variables are supported.

### Static vs Shared Libary
If `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` is set, the shared library is built. If
`BUILD_STATIC_LIBS` is set, the static library is built. If both are
set, both libraries will be built.  If neither is set, the static
library will be built.

### Static Library Name
`STATIC_SUFFIX`, if defined, will be appended to the static library
name.  For example,

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON -DSTATIC_SUFFIX=_static
cmake --build .
```

will create a static library named `libxtt_static.a`.

### Force Position Independent Code (-fPIC)
Set the standard CMake variable `CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` to
`ON` to force compilation with `-fPIC` for static libraries.  The
default is `OFF` for static libraries and `ON` for shared libraries.

### Disable Building of Tests
Set the standard CMake variable `BUILD_TESTING` to `OFF` to disable
the building of tests.  The default value is `ON`.

## Installation

CMake creates a target for installation.

```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --target install
```

Set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` variable when configuring the build to
modify the installation location.


## Usage
```
#include <xtt.h>
```
TODO: Add simple client and server source code

### Example Programs
If the `-DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` CMake option is used during building,
example client and server executables will be built and placed
in the `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin` directory.
Example configuration data is also provided in the `examples/data`
directory.

#### Server
To run the example server, first copy the necessary example data
into the working directory:
```bash
cp ${xtt_root_directory}/examples/data/server/* .
```

The server executable takes the TCP port to use as parameter:
```bash
xtt_server 4444
```

The server will then listen on that port for incoming identity-provisioning
requests, service them sequentially (the server is single-threaded),
and output the agreed-upon identity information exchanged with the client.

#### Client
To run the example client, first copy the necessary example data
into the working directory:
```bash
cp ${xtt_root_directory}/examples/data/client/* .
```

The client executable takes the `xtt_suite_spec` to use
(run the executable with no arguments to see what the options are)
and the IP and port of the server as parameters:
```bash
xtt_client 1 127.0.0.1 4444
```
(a suite_spec value of `1` indicates `XTT_X25519_LRSW_ED25519_CHACHA20POLY1305_SHA512`).

The client will then initiate an identity-provisioning handshake with the server
listening on the given IP and port,
and output the agreed-upon identity information exchanged with that server.
